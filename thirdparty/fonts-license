The font files (fonts/*.inl) are taken from:
http://nothings.org/stb/font/

According to the same source, all the contained code is in the public domain
(below is a copy of the statement).

===========================================================================

"All code is in the public domain. According to my best understanding of the law, 
digital outline fonts are programs and hence copyrightable, but the underlying 
typeface, and bitmaps created from the typeface, are not copyrightable. 
Therefore the copyright on the fonts used to create these bitmap fonts does not 
apply to these bitmaps, thus the entirety of the .inl files are in the public 
domain. For more information, see
